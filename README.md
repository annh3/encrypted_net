# Encrypted Net

This is to-be an implementation of a deep neural network which is homomorphically encrypted and takes inputs which are homomorphically encrypted via somewhat homomorphic encryption

Updates
01-20-2022: Debugged linear transformation via key-switch so that ciphertext dimensionality grows only from n to n+1, validated that the identity transformation in homomorphic space preserves plaintexts
